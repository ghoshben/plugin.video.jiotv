Kodi plugin features with a Material 3 interface that is optimised for remote
navigation.

## Features

- Browse channels by **Genres** and **Languages** using JioTV dictionaries.
- Authenticated playback of live streams via the JioTV APIs.
- Catch-up programmes and EPG listings where available.

flutter pub get
flutter analyze

The project depends on `flutter_tv` for Android TV focus support.
